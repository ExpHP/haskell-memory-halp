memory errors trying to parse a big yaml file with the `yaml` package

** Files

- app/attempt1 :: attempt using plain data structures that map directly to the YAML.
                  (originally handcoded, this has now been rewritten to use Aeson's
                   TemplateHaskell functions, with no discernable effect on the outcome)
- app/attempt2 :: attempt using a fromJSON implementation that extracts only the
                  data I want.

In my main source tree I also tried using an unboxed vector for the innermost `Vector (Complex Double)`.
This still did not help.

** Running

Watch a 4 MB test file take up 80 MB of "pinned" memory (bytestrings?):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    ./makeit 10 90 30
#+END_SRC

[[./saved/attempt1.ps]]

Larger numbers make a bigger file.
